\section{Applications}
Motivating the applicability of the described methods, we would like to shortly introduce a selection of research papers that build on this research. \newline

The paper \cite{ApplicPaper1:ThompsonSamplingWithGP} on Thompson sampling uses GPs as a tool to approximate costly to evaluate or black-box functions for optimization purposes and makes use of some iterative methods described. \cite{Paper6:ThompsonSamplingWithPosteriorSplit} introduces the idea of splitting the posterior seen in (\ref{eq:GPPosteriorSplit}) to facilitate a more scalable version of Thompson sampling that makes use of the cheap and accurate sampling. \newline

On another note the papers \cite{ApplicPaper2:GPwithBackoff,ApplicPaper3:PredictionScenarios} further improve the methods of using GPs in the context of model predictive control in similar fashion to the discussed methods for the scalar autonomous case with success.
